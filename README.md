This extension will look for link pattern in your page content and then convert it into an active link that you can click on it. Very useful especially in the comments because comment authors can now paste a link text and it will automatically turn into an active link in the HTML output.

This extension will not touch the link pattern inside `<script>`, `<style>` and `<textarea>` elements, in any element attribute&rsquo;s value, and will not convert the link text that is already inside an `<a>` element.
