=================================================================

This extension will look for link patterns in your page content and then convert them into active links that you can
click on. Very useful especially in comments, because comment authors can now paste a link text and it will
automatically turn into an active link in the HTML output.

This extension will not affect the link pattern inside of `<script>`, `<style>`, and `<textarea>` elements, in the value
of any element attribute, and will not convert the link text that is already inside of an `<a>` element.
